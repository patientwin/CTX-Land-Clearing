const faqItems = [
  {
    q: 'What is land clearing?',
    a: 'Land clearing is the process of removing unwanted vegetation, brush, and obstacles so property can be used more effectively for ranching, access, construction, or maintenance.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What is forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Forestry mulching uses specialized machinery to process brush and small trees into mulch on-site. It can reduce hauling while helping preserve topsoil compared with full scrape-and-haul methods.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the benefits of land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Common benefits include improved access, reduced overgrowth pressure, better project readiness, and easier ongoing property maintenance. Forestry mulching can also lower cleanup complexity on many scopes.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the different methods of land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Methods can include selective machine clearing, forestry mulching, stump removal, right-of-way opening, and grading support. The right method depends on property condition, timeline, and end goal.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the costs associated with land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Costs vary based on acreage, density of brush/cedar, access constraints, debris handling needs, and required finish quality. A scoped estimate is the best way to compare realistic options.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the best practices for land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Best practices include defining clear project goals, choosing appropriate equipment, protecting desired trees and access routes, and sequencing work so grading and next-phase prep are not delayed.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What types of equipment are used for land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Projects often use tracked skid steers, mulching heads, grapples, buckets, and support attachments. Additional equipment is selected when grading, haul, or specialized terrain work is needed.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are manual labor methods used for land clearing and forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Manual methods can include targeted trimming, hand-cutting in tight zones, debris staging, and detail cleanup where machinery access is limited.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the different types of bulldozers used for land clearing?',
    a: 'Dozers can be used for heavy pushing and broad reshaping when project scope calls for it. Equipment selection depends on slope, soil conditions, and clearing intensity.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the different types of excavators used for land clearing?',
    a: 'Excavators may be used for stump extraction, trenching, debris movement, and deep material handling. The machine size and attachment setup are chosen by site and scope.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the different brush cutters used for forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Forestry mulching heads and brush cutters vary by material size and terrain requirements. Proper matching improves throughput and finish quality while controlling disturbance.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What types of stump grinders are used for forestry mulching?',
    a: 'Stump treatment can involve grinding or removal, depending on end use of the site. The approach is chosen based on grading plans, construction goals, and budget.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can land clearing stop insect or pest infestations?',
    a: 'Clearing can reduce habitat pressure and overgrowth that contribute to pest issues, but it is not a complete pest-control substitute. Severe infestations may still require dedicated treatment.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Can land clearing prevent the growth of invasive plants?',
    a: 'Clearing can reduce current invasive growth and improve management conditions. Ongoing maintenance is still important to limit regrowth over time.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How does land clearing help to control erosion?',
    a: 'When paired with proper grading and drainage planning, clearing can improve water flow and reduce unmanaged runoff. Preserving practical ground cover is also part of erosion-aware planning.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Is brush removal the same as land clearing?',
    a: 'Not always. Brush removal is often one part of a larger land clearing scope, which may also include tree work, stump handling, access prep, and grading coordination.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How do you know which type of land clearing service you need for your property?',
    a: 'Start with your primary objective: access, construction prep, maintenance, visibility, or drainage support. Then match the service path to your timeline and site conditions.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How long will grading and leveling take on my property?',
    a: 'Timeline depends on property size, elevation changes, weather conditions, and finish requirements. Most projects can be staged with clearing so the next phase starts efficiently.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What Central Texas permits do I need for a land clearing project?',
    a: 'Permit requirements vary by location, project scope, and local rules. Utility considerations, protected zones, and municipal guidelines can all affect approvals.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What is fence line clearing, and why do you need it?',
    a: 'Fence line clearing opens overgrowth along boundaries to improve access, visibility, and maintenance. It is common for ranch properties and perimeter restoration projects.'
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I do with the debris after my land clearing project?',
    a: 'Debris strategy is typically planned before work begins. Depending on project goals, material may be mulched on-site, staged, hauled, or processed as part of the overall scope.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I find the best land clearing contractor in Central Texas?',
    a: 'Look for local project experience, clear communication, practical equipment fit, and transparent estimating. Strong contractor fit usually comes from process clarity, not price alone.'
  },
  {
    q: 'How to know if your land clearing contractor is licensed and insured?',
    a: 'Ask directly for proof of insurance and confirm business details before scheduling. A reliable contractor should be clear about coverage, process, and scope expectations.'
  }
