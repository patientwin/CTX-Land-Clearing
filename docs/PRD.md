# Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
The existing CTX site has ranking equity for local-intent service terms, but design and conversion flow are dated. A migration must preserve ranking signals while improving usability, form conversion, and technical quality.

## Business Goals
- Increase qualified estimate submissions.
- Increase tracked phone call clicks from mobile and desktop.
- Preserve lead quality by keeping clear service scope messaging.

## SEO Goals
- Preserve ranking continuity for high-intent existing URLs.
- Improve on-page relevance for Austin-focused terms.
- Improve metadata quality for better SERP CTR.

## UX Goals
- Make CTA paths obvious above the fold.
- Reduce form friction with quick and full form options.
- Keep consistent contact visibility across pages.

## Non-Goals
- Rebranding business identity.
- Adding heavy client-side app behavior.
- Publishing fabricated social proof or claims.

## Success Metrics
- No major ranking drop for top existing pages within 30 days.
- +20% increase in form submission rate on landing sessions.
- +15% increase in call-click events from mobile traffic.
- Lighthouse: Perf >= 90, Accessibility >= 95, BP >= 95, SEO >= 95.

## Launch Scope vs Post-Launch Scope
Launch:
- Parity-first migration pages, redirects, forms, technical SEO, crawl/parity tooling, QA tests.

Post-launch:
- Replace placeholder imagery with optimized project photos.
- Integrate CRM webhook destination.
- Add area-specific landing pages once performance baseline is stable.
