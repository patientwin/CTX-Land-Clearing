# UX Conversion Plan

## CTA Strategy
- Primary CTA: `Get Free Estimate` above fold.
- Secondary CTA: sticky and header `Call` links.
- Service-page CTAs repeated after descriptive content.
- Added two-button CTA groups (estimate + call) on core service pages.
- Added bottom-of-home CTA row (`Submit Full Estimate` and `Compare Services`) to catch mid-scroll users.

## Form Placement Strategy
- Quick form in homepage hero.
- Full form on contact page and lower-funnel section.
- Thank-you page confirms completion and reduces uncertainty.

## Trust Elements
- Trust band communicates local focus and process clarity.
- About page explains method and land-preserving approach.
- Consistent contact data across header/footer/contact page.

## Friction Reduction
- Short quick form for early-stage leads.
- Full form captures qualified details when user intent is higher.
- Inline validation with plain language error messages.
- Added form helper microcopy (`Takes about 60 seconds` / `faster scope response`) to reduce perceived effort.
- Added mobile-friendly `inputmode="tel"` and `autocomplete="street-address"` hints for faster completion.
- Improved required-field messaging reliability by deriving labels directly from associated form controls.

## Mobile Behavior
- Sticky call button always visible on mobile.
- Large tap targets and readable form controls.
- Focus-visible styles for keyboard and assistive usage.
- Service cards now include optimized lazy-loaded previews to support faster visual decision-making without heavy JS.
