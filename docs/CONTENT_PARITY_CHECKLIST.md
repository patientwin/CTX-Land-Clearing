## Missing Content Tracker
- Original media assets were not fully downloadable in this environment.
- Structured testimonial/review blocks were not reliably extractable from crawl and were not fabricated.

### Condensed/Adapted Copy Diff Log
- Source limits: exact full old homepage body copy was not fully extractable from crawl snapshots.
- Adaptation 1:
  Old intent: "Most people don't know that land clearing doesn't involve scraping all the topsoil off your property..."
  New copy: retained verbatim first sentence and preserved erosion/drainage rationale.
  Reason: preserve known high-signal parity line while keeping modern section scannability.
- Adaptation 2:
  Old intent: multiple homepage service teasers across a larger block set.
  New copy: condensed each service teaser into one-sentence card excerpts.
  Reason: maintain coverage intent/count while fitting the new card-based visual system.
